2. Indication of the annotation round ("NR"= Naive round, "KR" = Knowledge round)
3. Curator initials correspond to curator numbers in the manuscript as: WD = C1, AD = C2, NI = C3, GS = Gold Standard
4. File names starting with "PP" contain Partial Precision scores
5. File names starting with "PR" contain Partial Recall scores
